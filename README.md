# Hackerrank
This repository contains my solutions for a couple of coding challenges from hackerrank.com. The challenges are from the categories

- problem solving (medium to hard) 
- algorithms & data structures (medium to hard)
 
and were solved with a focus on minimizing time and space complexity (Python 3). Every file has been accepted by hackerrank.com and solves the respective coding challenge.
